As far as I know, Its the liason between the kernel and the user. 
Before there was only user-interface and all what developer do's is that. Now there is GUI & CLI as well. 
Shell basically takes the command from user and run/execute it in the operating system. 
- Shell is the earlier version of the Linux shell defined by sh
- There is an enhanced version of Shell done by Steve Bourne called as Bourne again shell ( or most commonly known as bash)
- There are other shell program varients  : zsh, ksh, tcsh

## Terminal .
 - This program is  called terminal emulator actually. 
 - This program gives us the window to interact by command  with the shell. 
 - There are couple of terminal emulators, xterm, gnome-terminal , konsole, wrap

```bash
kjflakjahkfjalk
```

**Legacy operating system:** This is system that are outdated or something that was wiped away.

Unix Shell is both Command and scripting Language.
Operating system is basically a couple of shell scripts to control the execution.
User use terminal emulator to write and interact with unix shell
There are direct operation via serial hardware. or secure shell for server system 
All Unix shells provide filename [wildcarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character "Wildcard character"), [piping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_\(Unix\) "Pipeline (Unix)"), [here documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document "Here document"), [command substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_substitution "Command substitution"), [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_\(programming\) "Variable (programming)") and [control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow "Control flow") for [condition-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_\(programming\) "Conditional (programming)") and [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration").
