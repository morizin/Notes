\section {Matrix Multiplication}
We have been learning Matrix Multiplication since High School. Its a great tool. Matrix Multiplication can be said as dot product of row of one matrix with the columns of other matrix.

\subsection{Matrix Multiplication with Divide and Conquer.}
Divide and Conquer is the method of dividing a large problem into smaller same problem for which we know the answer and then combining it. 
\paragraph{How do we use Divide And Conquer for Matrix muliplication}
