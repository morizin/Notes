**Algorithm:** Its the computational procedure of computer program. its just the step by step procedure how a program should flow and work for solving problem.

In Software Engineering Lifecycle, There are two phases:

1. Design Phase
2. Implementation Phase

#### Design Phase

In this Phase Developer design the system the algorithm . Make your design perfect. So you have an idea what are you developing

#### Implementation Phase

This is where the developer takes the program and start implementing it. Of course, In software engineering, you can implement something and delete. But we lose a lot of time. doing it. Its possible to Trial and Error.

So if we write program in Implementation phase then what do we write in Design Phase. It should be in english like statement.

- There won't be any syntax.
- Its just intented to understand the underlying workflow.
- We won't be using any programming Language i.e. Algorithm.

| Design Phase                                                                | Implementation Phase   |
| Domain Knowledge                                                            | Programmer             |
| Any language, something that people understandable to someone who's reading | Programming Language   |
| HW & OS (independent)                                                       | Dependent and H/W & OS |
| Analyze if our algorithm is perfect, efficient                              | Testing                |
| Syntax : Most people know C language                                        |                        |

## Priori Analysis & Posteriori Testing

We analyze the algorithm and we make it into bits and pieces and then calculate several metrics such as time and space **Function**. This is priori Analysis.
In Posteriori Testing, we actually execute this program and we get the real values.

| Priori Analysis         | Posteriori Testing |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Algorithm               | Program            |
| Independent of Language | Language Dependent |
| Hardware Independent    | Hardware dependent |
| Time & space Function   | Watch time & Bytes |

Characteristics of Algorithm

1. Input ---------- 0 or more
2. Output --------- It must kind at least one output
3. Definiteness
4. Finiteness ------ Since Algorithm is `func`, it should stop at some point
5. Effectiveness ----
